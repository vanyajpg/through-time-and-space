# Through Space & Time 🪐

ThroughSpace allows users to explore space and astronomy through utilizing NASA's APOD API. Users can input specific dates to retrieve historical content, view stunning images, and learn about various celestial events and phenomena. It provides an interactive and visually engaging platform for space enthusiasts and learners to discover the universe's wonders.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: React.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript ES6

Ever since I was a child, I've had a deep fascination with observing and tracking celestial events in outer space. One of my earliest birthday gifts was a pair of binoculars, which allowed me to appreciate the planets in the night sky. Creating this app became a meaningful way for me to not only share my passion with others but also to expand my knowledge of celestial phenomena.

# Optimizations

I hope to add authentication & profiles so that users can save their favorite APOD entries. Another feature to add is the ability to send a daily notification to users, alerting them of the celestial event and image for the day.

# Lessons Learned:

While developing this project, I solidified my understanding of handling asynchronous data fetching and conditional rendering of components.
